# DiscoverFlow AI - Product Overview

## What It Does
DiscoverFlow AI transforms how researchers find and analyze academic literature. Instead of spending weeks manually searching databases, researchers simply input their research question and receive comprehensive literature analysis from AI agents that simultaneously explore multiple academic sources including PubMed, ArXiv, and Google Scholar.

## How It Works
Enter your research question in plain English. Multiple AI agents immediately begin parallel searches across academic databases, each focusing on different aspects of your inquiry. Watch real-time progress as the system identifies relevant papers, evaluates source credibility, and extracts key findings. Within minutes, receive a structured report containing pertinent research, methodology insights, and identified knowledge gaps—all with proper academic citations.
